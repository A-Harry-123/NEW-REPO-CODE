        <h1>INRODUCTION OF HTML <HTML><P>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is a markup language used to create web pages and describe their structure. HTML is made up of a series of elements that tell web browsers how to display content. 
            Here are some things to know about HTML:
            
                How it works
                HTML is made up of short codes, or tags, that are typed into a text file. The text is then saved as an HTML file and viewed in a web browser. The browser reads the file and translates the text into a visible form based on the tags. 
            
            How it's used
            HTML is used to create sections, paragraphs, links, tables, lists, images, and more. It's often used with Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) to change the look of HTML, and JavaScript to add functionality. 
            History
            HTML was created in 1990 by Tim Berners-Lee, a British computer scientist who also invented the World Wide Web. The current standard version of HTML is HTML 5, which was released in 2014. 
            Benefits
            HTML is beginner-friendly, accessible, and flexible. It runs natively in all web browsers.
